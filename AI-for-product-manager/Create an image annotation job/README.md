## Overview
This job helps doctors quickly identify cases of pneumonia in children

## Steps
Examine the image.
If the image is pneumonia or normal, check the appropriate radio button.
In cases where the image is confusing, select either unknown.
## Rules And Tips
### Rules:

Annotators should pay attention to the diaphragm and the lungs areas as they are the areas that mostly carry visual symptoms that indicate pneumonia.
lungs without cloudiness and opacity indicate a normal-healthy image( absence of pneumonia )
Any image with an obscured diaphragm shadow indicates potential pneumonia case.
Any image with general or concentrated cloudiness and or opacity over the lungs and or the diaphragm depicts potential pneumonia case.
Any image not showing a clear indication of pneumonia and not having the signs of a normal lung and diaphragm, is to be considered an unknown case. In such a case, we interpret that a medical expert is required to determine the situation of the child.
### Tips:

If the image is animated, make sure to watch the whole thing before answering!
Look closely and carefully at images before deciding whether it depicts pneumonia or not.
